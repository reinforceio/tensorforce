    Basic Reinforcement learning agent. An agent encapsulates execution logic

    The agent hence acts as an intermediate layer between environment
    and backend execution (value function or policy updates).

            states_spec (dict): Dict containing at least one state-component definition. In the case of a single state
                space component, the keys `shape` and `type` are necessary (e.g. a 3D float-box with shape [3,3,3]).
                For multiple state components, pass a dict of dicts where each component is a dict itself with a unique
                name as its key (e.g. {cam: {shape: [84,84], type=int}, health: {shape=(), type=float}}).
            actions_spec (dict): Dict containing at least one action-component definition.
                Action components have types and either `num_actions` for discrete actions or a `shape`
                for continuous actions.

                session invocation to update rewards in the graph, which will lower the throughput.
